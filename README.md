  ## Description
  This is a react powered application that serves as a portfolio to show employers. To view, go here! https://joshuaorlandor.github.io/Challenge-20-React-Portfolio/ 

  ## Requirements
  This application just requires the link to view, it is not a practical application that serves a purpose for the average user. 

  ## Installation
  Users do not need to install this application, however, they can, if they want, run this page locally. To do so, download the repository and open it in a coding enviornment like VS code. In a terminal, run npm i and npm start, to install dependencies, and launch the page locally. Otherwise, just view the live app with the github pages link!
